A game in which circles absorb other circles. One of them might be the player.
Made using the Unity engine. You can view the project repository [here](https://github.com/lyao6104/CircleGame).

Originally, this project was meant to have a lot more content, in the form of more
enemies, levels, smarter AI, and so on. Unfortunately, school kind of got in the way
of it, and I eventually lost interest. That being said, what already exists might be worth
checking out, even if the gameplay is a bit simple.
