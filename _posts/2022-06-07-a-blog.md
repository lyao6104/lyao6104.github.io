It's kind of funny that I've only *just* decided that it would be worth adding a blog,
since it seems like this is one of the main features of Jekyll. Oh well. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

In any case, here it is. I probably still won't use this much, but from time to time,
I might use this to talk about new tools or technologies that I find interesting,
or share progress on any projects of mine.
