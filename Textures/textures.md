## Textures

On this page, you can find various textures that I've made, most of which are from
my work with McMaster Start Coding. Unless otherwise specified, all textures are licensed under
[Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).

Do note that, while I will *try* to make sure these URLs don't change, there is no guarantee that they will always stay the same.
