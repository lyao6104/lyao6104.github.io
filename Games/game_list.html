<!-- CircleGame -->
<h2>
    CircleGame
</h2>
<p>
    A game in which circles absorb other circles. One of them might be the player.
    Made using the Unity engine. You can view the project repository <a href="https://github.com/lyao6104/CircleGame">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
    Originally, this project was meant to have a lot more content, in the form of more
    enemies, levels, smarter AI, and so on. Unfortunately, school kind of got in the way
    of it, and I eventually lost interest. That being said, what already exists might be worth
    checking out, even if the gameplay is a bit simple.

<!-- GravitySim -->
<h2>
    2D Gravity Sandbox
</h2>
<p>
    A small 2D gravity sandbox made using Unity. If I remember correctly, I think
    this is also the first game in which I tried to add mobile support, since you can tap to add dust specks
    instead of using the mouse. You can view the project repository <a href="https://github.com/lyao6104/Gravity2D">here</a>.
